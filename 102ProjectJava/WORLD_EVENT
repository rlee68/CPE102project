1) Right click causes the wyvern and yoshi to spawn.
   Left click causes a field of flowers to take up 5*5 tiles around the mouse.

2) The wyvern goes and changes the miners into mario and the yoshi goes and 
   changes the ores into green mushrooms.

3) The mario then goes and collect the mushrooms.

4) Same as #2.
